# Explanatory-Data-Analysis-on-Car_Sales_Data

**Introduction to Data Analysis with Python**

Welcome to this module on Introduction to Data Analysis with Python. you'll learn about an example around estimating used car prices that we will analyze in this course, using Python.

* To obtain basic insights from the dataset on used cars and their prices.
* "Can we estimate the price of a used car based on its characteristics?"
* To answer this question, we are going to use various Python packages to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model development and model evaluation.
* But before we begin talking about the problem (used car prices), we should first understand
  the importance of data analysis.

**Why Data Analysis?.**
* Data is everywhere
* Data analysis, and in essence, data science, helps us unlock the information and insights from raw data, to answer our questions.
* So data analysis plays an important role by helping us to discover useful information from the data.
* Predict the future or the unknown.

# Problem
* Let's say we have a friend named Tom.
* Tom wants to sell his car.
* But the problem is, he doesn't know how much he should sell his car for.
* Tom wants to sell his car for as much as he can.
* But he also wants to set the price reasonably so someone would want to purchase it.
* So the price he sets should represent the value of the car.
* How can we help Tom determine the best price for his car?
* Let's think like data scientists and clearly define some of his problems:
  For example, is there data on the prices of other cars and their characteristics?
* What features of cars affect their prices?
  Colour? ,Brand?
Does horsepower also affect the selling price, or perhaps, something else?
As a data analyst or data scientist, these are some of the questions we can start thinking.
